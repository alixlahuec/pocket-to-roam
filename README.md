## Pocket2Roam

A Chrome extension to export Pocket highlights into Roam.
If you're a regular user of both Pocket and Roam, you might be interested in the [weekly Pocket -> Roam import of unread items](https://github.com/greenmeen/pocket-weekly-archive) I use to manage my to-read list. 
 
 ### Installation
 
 > :white_check_mark: The extension is now available directly [from the Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocket2roam/dabfafdmfkapaihojoaefmkdjiieignm?hl=fr&authuser=4)
 
 For manual installation, download the latest version from the Releases panel, unzip the folder, then follow these steps : 
  - Go to your browser's Extensions panel.
  = Make sure that the 'Developer Mode' toggle is turned on. It's usually located in the top-right corner of the page.
  - There should now be several buttons available to you, listed above your extensions list. Click on "Load unpacked", then select the folder on your device where you previously unzipped the extension's files. 
  - If all went well, you should now be able to see Pocket2Roam in your list of extensions.
